# Kitafinder

If you ever needed to find a Kita in Berlin, you know how difficult it is.
While this app doesn't really help solve this problem (there are no users), it was fun to build.

The idea was to build a web app that connects parents and Kitas.

Also, it was my graduation project at Spiced and I passed, so it must be good enough.
